<h1>PixivDownloader</h1>
<p>&emsp;A simple script to maintain a collection of illustrations of your favorite anime character.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  &emsp;This script implements a web crawler, resource downloader and resource manager. 
  By running a script, you can update and maintain a specific collection of illustrations 
  by setting related parameters such as keywords. 
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;What the does script do can be discribed as follows.
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;First, information acquisition for the target image is achieved by the crawler 
  (using the pixivpy App-api). Then, the picture information already in the collection 
  is tracked by the record file (illust_data.csv) to check if a new picture does not 
  appear in the set. After that, a download task is generated, and the download task 
  is performed by the thread pool. Finally, maintain and update the log file.
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;It's worth mentioning that this script simply implements some lightweight features, 
  just as an automated script designed to maintain a small image collection. There 
  are a lot of problems that are not well solved, just use some 'patches' to 
  make the function work for now. 
   &emsp;So, just use it as a simple wheelbarrow.
