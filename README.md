<h1>PixivDownloader</h1>
<p>&emsp;A simple script to maintain a collection of illustrations of your favorite anime character.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  &emsp;This script implements a web crawler, resource downloader and resource manager. 
  By running the script, you can update and maintain a specific collection of illustrations 
  by setting related parameters such as keywords. 
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;What the does script do can be discribed as follows.
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;First, information of the target illustration is scanned by the crawler 
  (using the pixivpy App-api). Then, a CSV file (illust_data.csv) is used to track 
  all the illustrations that have already been downloaded, which means the illustrations 
  will not be downloaded twice. After that, a download task is generated, and the task 
  is performed by the thread pool. Finally, the CSV file will bem updated and a summary 
  will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;It's worth mentioning that this script simply implements some lightweight features, 
  just as an automated script designed to maintain a small image collection. There 
  are a lot of problems that are not well solved, just use some 'patches' to 
  make the function work for now. 
</p>
<p>
   &emsp;The idea is merely craw and download some illustrations from pixiv, so it is far from being 
  a reliable and decent tool. So, just use it as a simple wheelbarrow.
</p>
